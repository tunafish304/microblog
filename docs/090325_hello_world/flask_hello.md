##  Project Structure

```bash
090325_microblog_hello/
├── app/                  # Flask package
│   ├── init.py       # Creates and exposes the Flask app instance
│   └── routes.py         # Defines routes using @app.route
├── microblog.py          # Entry point: imports and runs the app
├── .flaskenv             # Tells Flask where to find the app
├── .gitattributes        # Git config for cross-platform consistency
├── .gitignore            # Tells Git which files to ignore
└── requirements.txt      # (Optional) pip install list
```

##  File Roles

| File             | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/__init__.py`| Creates the Flask app instance and imports routes        |
| `app/routes.py`  | Defines route(s) using `@app.route` decorator            |
| `microblog.py`   | Imports the app instance and runs the server             |
| `.flaskenv`      | Sets `FLASK_APP=microblog.py` so Flask knows what to run |

---


## How `from app import app` Works

```python
# microblog.py
from app import app
```

This line means:
- “Go into the `app/` folder”
- “Run `init.py`”
- “Grab the `app = Flask(name)` instance from there”

>  Two meanings of “app”:
> - `app/` is the folder (a Python package)
> - `app` is the Flask instance created inside `init.py`

---

##  How the App Flows

```text
.flaskenv sets FLASK_APP=microblog.py
↓
microblog.py runs → from app import app
↓
app/init.py runs → creates app instance
↓
app/routes.py runs → defines routes using @app.route
↓
Flask now knows how to respond to requests
```

##  What Is a Decorator?

In `routes.py`, you’ll see:

```python
from app import app

@app.route('/')
def hello():
	return "Hello, Flask!"
```

This uses a decorator: `@app.route('/')`.



###  What a Decorator Does

A decorator is a function that wraps another function to change or extend its behavior.

Here’s a simplified example:

```python
def shout(func):
	def wrapper():
		return func().upper()
	return wrapper

@shout
def greet():
	return "hello"

print(greet())  # Outputs: "HELLO"
```

>  Teaching Tip:  
> - `@shout` rewrites `greet()` so it returns uppercase text.  
> - Similarly, `@app.route('/')` rewrites `hello()` so Flask knows to call it when someone visits `/`.

---

##  Try It Yourself

Add a second route in `routes.py`:

```python
@app.route('/goodbye')
def goodbye():
	return "Goodbye, Flask!"
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000/goodbye` in your browser.

##  Why Does Flask Know to Call `hello()` for `/`?

Flask uses the `@app.route()` decorator to register a function as the handler for a specific URL. Internally, it builds a routing table like:

```python
{
	'/': hello,
	'/about': about_page,
	'/contact': contact_form,
}
```

So when a browser requests `/`, Flask looks up the route and calls the associated function (`hello()` in this case). It doesn’t care what the function is named—it just needs the mapping.

---
## Circular imports

###  What’s the problem?

In Flask apps, you often split your code into modules for clarity:
- `app.py` defines the Flask app instance (`app = Flask(__name__)`)
- `routes.py` defines the view functions (routes), and needs access to `app`

But here’s the catch:
- `app.py` needs to import `routes.py` to register the routes
- `routes.py` needs to import `app` from `app.py` to decorate route functions

This creates a **circular import**:
```
app.py → imports routes.py
routes.py → imports app from app.py
```
Python tries to resolve these imports top-down, and when it hits the cycle, one of the modules may be only partially initialized — leading to `ImportError` or `AttributeError`.

### Grinberg’s workaround: bottom import

To break the cycle, Grinberg delays the import of `routes` until **after** the `app` object is fully defined:
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# other setup...

from app import routes  # imported at the bottom
```
This way:
- `app.py` finishes defining `app`
- Then it imports `routes.py`, which can safely import `app` without triggering a circular mess

###  Why this works

Python modules are only executed once per interpreter session. So by the time `routes.py` imports `app`, the `app` object already exists. It’s a bit like saying: “Let’s finish building the house before inviting guests to walk through it.”

##  Summary

- `microblog.py` is the entry point
- `app/init.py` creates the Flask app
- `app/routes.py` defines how URLs map to functions
- Decorators like `@app.route` wrap functions to register them with Flask
