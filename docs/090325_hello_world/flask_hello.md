## 🗂️ Project Structure

```bash
090325_microblog_hello/
├── app/                  # Flask package
│   ├── init.py       # Creates and exposes the Flask app instance
│   └── routes.py         # Defines routes using @app.route
├── microblog.py          # Entry point: imports and runs the app
├── .flaskenv             # Tells Flask where to find the app
├── .gitattributes        # Git config for cross-platform consistency
├── .gitignore            # Tells Git which files to ignore

## 📄 File Roles

| File             | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/__init__.py`| Creates the Flask app instance and imports routes        |
| `app/routes.py`  | Defines route(s) using `@app.route` decorator            |
| `microblog.py`   | Imports the app instance and runs the server             |
| `.flaskenv`      | Sets `FLASK_APP=microblog.py` so Flask knows what to run |

Let me know if you'd like me to regenerate the full `flask_hello.md` with this fix applied, or if you'd prefer to keep moving forward with the next artifact.


## 🔁 How `from app import app` Works

```python
# microblog.py
from app import app
```

This line means:
- “Go into the `app/` folder”
- “Run `init.py`”
- “Grab the `app = Flask(name)` instance from there”

> 🧠 Two meanings of “app”:
> - `app/` is the folder (a Python package)
> - `app` is the Flask instance created inside `init.py`

---

## 🧵 How the App Flows

```text
.flaskenv sets FLASK_APP=microblog.py
↓
microblog.py runs → from app import app
↓
app/init.py runs → creates app instance
↓
app/routes.py runs → defines routes using @app.route
↓
Flask now knows how to respond to requests
```

## 🧠 What Is a Decorator?

In `routes.py`, you’ll see:

```python
from app import app

@app.route('/')
def hello():
	return "Hello, Flask!"
```

This uses a decorator: `@app.route('/')`.



### 🔍 What a Decorator Does

A decorator is a function that wraps another function to change or extend its behavior.

Here’s a simplified example:

```python
def shout(func):
	def wrapper():
		return func().upper()
	return wrapper

@shout
def greet():
	return "hello"

print(greet())  # Outputs: "HELLO"
```

> 🧠 Teaching Tip:  
> - `@shout` rewrites `greet()` so it returns uppercase text.  
> - Similarly, `@app.route('/')` rewrites `hello()` so Flask knows to call it when someone visits `/`.

---

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

Add a second route in `routes.py`:

```python
@app.route('/goodbye')
def goodbye():
	return "Goodbye, Flask!"
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000/goodbye` in your browser.

## 🧪 Wrapped Example of `@app.route('/')`

Here’s how you might wrap the `hello()` function to log when it’s called—useful for debugging or teaching:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(name)

def log_call(func):
	def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
		print(f"Calling function: {func.name}")
		return func(*args, **kwargs)
	return wrapper

@app.route('/')
@log_call
def hello():
	return "Hello, Flask!"
```

### 🔍 What’s happening here?

- `@app.route('/')` tells Flask: “When someone visits the root URL `/`, call this function.”
- `@log_call` wraps `hello()` so that every time it’s called, it prints a message first.
- The order matters: Flask sees the final version of `hello()` after it’s been wrapped.

---

## 🧭 Why Does Flask Know to Call `hello()` for `/`?

Flask uses the `@app.route()` decorator to register a function as the handler for a specific URL. Internally, it builds a routing table like:

```python
{
	'/': hello,
	'/about': about_page,
	'/contact': contact_form,
}
```

So when a browser requests `/`, Flask looks up the route and calls the associated function (`hello()` in this case). It doesn’t care what the function is named—it just needs the mapping.

---

## 🔁 Why Does the Function Get “Rewritten”?

When you use a decorator like `@log_call`, you're replacing the original function with a new one that adds behavior. This is Python’s way of saying:

> “Take `hello()`, pass it to `log_call`, and use the result instead.”

So Flask ends up calling the wrapped version of `hello()`—which still returns `"Hello, Flask!"`, but now also logs the call.
---

## 🧠 Summary

- `microblog.py` is the entry point
- `app/init.py` creates the Flask app
- `app/routes.py` defines how URLs map to functions
- Decorators like `@app.route` wrap functions to register them with Flask
