## üì¶ Installation Overview: macOS vs Windows

Use this table to see what you need to install based on your operating system.

| Tool                  | macOS                                                                 | Windows 11                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**            | Already installed (`python3 --version`) <br> If missing: [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) | [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) <br> ‚úÖ Add to PATH during install |
| **VS Code**           | [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <br> Drag to Applications | [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <br> Installer handles PATH setup |
| **Git**               | Already installed <br> If missing: `brew install git` (requires Homebrew) | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) <br> ‚úÖ Installs at system level |
| **WSL**               | Not needed                        | Run in PowerShell as Admin:<br>`wsl --install`<br>‚úÖ Reboot required |
| **VS Code Extensions**| Use GUI: `Ctrl+Shift+X` ‚Üí Search & Install | Same as macOS |
| **VS Code Settings**  | Use `.vscode/settings.json` inside your project folder | Same as macOS |

## üß± Setting Up WSL (Windows Only)

If you're on Windows, you'll need to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's how to do it:

### üîß Step 1: Run the Install Command

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and type:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

You‚Äôll see messages like:

```
Installing: WSL
Installing: Ubuntu
Downloading‚Ä¶
Installing‚Ä¶
```

Let it run ‚Äî this part can take a few minutes.

---

### üîÑ Step 2: Reboot When Prompted

When the install finishes, you‚Äôll see:

```
The requested operation is successful. Changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted.
```

Go ahead and restart your computer. This is required to finish the setup.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Step 3: First Boot (Ubuntu Setup)

After rebooting, Windows will automatically launch a terminal window. You‚Äôll see:

```
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Please create a user account.
```

This means Ubuntu is finishing its setup. You‚Äôre almost there.

---

### üë§ Step 4: Create Your Linux Username & Password

Next, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter:

```
Enter new UNIX username:
```

Type a short name (like `alex`, `student1`, or your first name). Then you‚Äôll be asked to set a password:

```
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
```

You won‚Äôt see the password as you type ‚Äî that‚Äôs normal. Just type it carefully both times.

‚úÖ This account is your Linux identity inside WSL. You‚Äôll use it when installing packages or running commands.

---

### üß™ Step 5: Confirm You‚Äôre Inside Ubuntu

After you enter your password and hit return, Ubuntu finishes setting up and drops you into your Linux shell. You‚Äôll see a prompt like this:



```bash
student1@DESKTOP-XXXX:~$
```

This means you‚Äôre inside Ubuntu and ready to go.

---

### üêç Step 6: Install Python (if needed)

Type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see something like `Command 'python3' not found`, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

This installs Python and pip inside Ubuntu. You‚Äôll be using this Python environment for your projects.

---

## üîå Install VS Code Extensions (GUI Only)

Now that VS Code is installed, let‚Äôs add the extensions you‚Äôll need. Open VS Code and press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions tab. Then search for each extension below and click **Install**.

| Extension Name                     | What It Does                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Remote - WSL**                  | Connect VS Code to WSL (Windows only)         |
| **GitHub Copilot**                | AI code suggestions                           |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat**           | Chat-based coding assistant                   |
| **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** | GitHub integration for PRs and issues        |
| **Python Indent**                 | Smart indentation for Python                  |
| **Black Formatter**               | Auto-format Python code                       |
| **Debugpy**                       | Python debugging support                      |
| **Python**                        | Core Python extension                         |
| **Pylance**                       | Fast Python language server                   |
| **Python Environments**           | Manage Python virtual environments            |
| **Live Server**                   | Preview HTML/CSS/JS in browser                |

üí° If your project folder includes a `.vscode/extensions.json` file, VS Code will prompt you to install any missing extensions automatically.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è VS Code Settings

Inside your project folder, create a `.vscode/` folder and add a file called `settings.json`. Paste the following into it:

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,

  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,

  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,

  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,

  "liveServer.settings.port": 5500,

  "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false
}
```

This file helps VS Code remember your preferences and automatically configure your environment when you open the folder.

---

## üìÑ Optional: Extension Recommendations

You can also add a file called `extensions.json` inside your `.vscode/` folder. This helps VS Code prompt you to install any missing extensions when you open the project.

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl",
    "github.copilot",
    "github.copilot-chat",
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github",
    "kevinrose.vsc-python-indent",
    "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "ms-python.debugpy",
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
    "ms-python.vscode-python-envs",
    "ritwickdey.liveserver"
  ]
}
```
