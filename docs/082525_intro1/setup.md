# Class 1: Getting Started

Today we want to go over what we'll be doing all semester and keep it all at a high level.

---

## 1. Introducing the online tutorial

- As a proof of concept, I have gone through the chapters and created the microblog and deployed it on PythonAnywhere's free tier
- There will no no out of pocket costs for this deployment or for the transalation service. I have created a custom python module for translation
- As Yoda said, "There is no try. There is only do."

## 2. Browse, Diff, and Zip

- Each chapter has a Browse, Diff, and Zip link for that chapter

---

## 3. Text → Code → Text → Code

- There is a pattern that Miguel uses
- He discusses a section of code and then he diplays the code
- We will do as much of the homework as we can in class together
- Miguel is a master at organization - the blog is a model for any code project

## 4. How to turn in homework

- There is a file on Moodle under class materials that explains this

## 5. Windows Version Check

- Press `Windows Key + R`, type `winver`, and hit Enter.
- If you have Windows 11 everything is peachy
- If you have **Windows 10**, you need version 2004 or later

---

## 6. Python Check

- Open Command Prompt and type:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
- If Python isn’t installed, we’ll cover it in Class 2.

## 7. What Is MVC?

- **Model**: Data and logic (e.g., blog posts).
- **View**: What users see (HTML templates).
- **Controller**: Routes and actions (Python functions).

## 8. Walk through of the Microblog on PythonAnywhere

- Let's check this puppy out and use it to class communications
- Limited space on a free tier
